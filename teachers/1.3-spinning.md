# Lesson 1.3: Spinning

**Student file:** `students/1.3-spinning.py`

## Prior Lessons Recap

In **Lesson 1.1**, students learned:
- **Robot**: Moving forward with `robot_go_ms()` and stopping with `robot_stop()`
- **Python**: Function calls, arguments, and comments

In **Lesson 1.2**, students learned:
- **Robot**: Moving in reverse by changing the direction argument
- **Python**: Enums as named values (`RxDirection.FORWARD` vs `RxDirection.REVERSE`)

## Learning Objectives

### Robot Concepts
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Make the robot spin in place (left or right) with `robot_rotate_ms()`
- Understand the difference between moving (forward/reverse) and spinning (left/right)
- Combine spinning with forward/reverse movement

### Python Concepts
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Compare similar functions (`robot_go_ms` vs `robot_rotate_ms`) and understand their differences
- Recognize that different enums exist for different purposes (`RxDirection` vs `RxRobotDirection`)
- Read function names to guess what they might do

## Teaching Notes

### Pacing (15-18 minutes)

1. **Recap (2 min)**: Review forward and reverse from previous lessons
2. **Demonstrate spinning (2 min)**: Physically show what spinning means vs. moving
3. **Introduce new function (4 min)**: Compare `robot_rotate_ms` to `robot_go_ms`
4. **Code walkthrough (4 min)**: Go through the spinning code
5. **Experimentation (5 min)**: Students try different spin durations and speeds

### Key Points to Emphasize

- Spinning keeps the robot in one place but facing different directions
- Moving (forward/reverse) changes location but keeps facing the same way
- We use different functions for different types of motion
- Different enums: `RxDirection` (FORWARD/REVERSE) vs `RxRobotDirection` (LEFT/RIGHT)

### Teaching the Python Concepts

#### Comparing Similar Functions
- `robot_go_ms` and `robot_rotate_ms` are structured the same way
- Both take: direction, speed, duration (in milliseconds)
- The name tells you what they do: "go" vs "rotate"
- The "_ms" at the end means "milliseconds"

#### Different Enum Types
- Ask: "Why can't we use `RxDirection.LEFT`?"
- Explain: `RxDirection` only has FORWARD and REVERSE
- `RxRobotDirection` has LEFT and RIGHT
- Different "menus" for different purposes
- The prefix helps: `Rx` = robot, then `Direction` or `RobotDirection`

#### Reading Function Names
- Encourage students to guess what functions do from their names
- `robot_rotate_ms` = robot + rotate + ms (milliseconds)
- Good programmers name things clearly so code is readable

### Common Student Mistakes

- **Using wrong enum**: `RxDirection.LEFT` doesn't exist - use `RxRobotDirection.LEFT`
- **Confusing rotation with turning while moving**: Rotation spins in place
- **Too fast spinning**: High speeds can be disorienting - start with 30-50

## Discussion Prompts

1. "What's the difference between spinning and turning? Can you show me with your body?"
2. "Why do you think there are separate enums for Forward/Reverse and Left/Right?"
3. "Look at `robot_go_ms` and `robot_rotate_ms` - what's similar? What's different?"
4. "If you wanted to face a different direction and then move forward, which would you do first?"

## Extension Activities

### Easy: Full Rotation
How long does it take to spin in a complete circle (360 degrees)? Experiment to find out!

### Medium: Turn and Go
Create a sequence where the robot: goes forward, spins left, goes forward again. Like turning a corner!

### Challenge: Square Dance
Make the robot trace a square: forward, spin 90 degrees, forward, spin 90 degrees, etc.

### Creative: Dizzy Robot
Make the robot spin back and forth rapidly - like it's looking around confused!
