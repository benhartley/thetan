# Lesson 1.4: Sequences

**Student file:** `students/1.4-sequences.py`

## Prior Lessons Recap

In **Lesson 1.1**, students learned:
- **Robot**: Moving forward with `robot_go_ms()` and stopping
- **Python**: Function calls, arguments, and comments

In **Lesson 1.2**, students learned:
- **Robot**: Moving in reverse
- **Python**: Enums as named values, changing arguments

In **Lesson 1.3**, students learned:
- **Robot**: Spinning left and right with `robot_rotate_ms()`
- **Python**: Comparing similar functions, different enum types

## Learning Objectives

### Robot Concepts
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Combine multiple movements to create a sequence
- Understand that complex patterns are made of simple steps
- Create a shape (like a square) by combining forward movement and turns

### Python Concepts
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand **program flow** - code executes from top to bottom
- Recognize that the order of commands matters
- See how repetitive patterns emerge in code

## Teaching Notes

### Pacing (20-25 minutes)

1. **Recap (3 min)**: Quick review of all previous lessons
2. **Introduction to sequences (3 min)**: Explain that we'll combine movements
3. **Plan the pattern (5 min)**: Draw a square, identify the steps needed
4. **Code walkthrough (5 min)**: Go through the square-drawing code
5. **Run and observe (3 min)**: Watch the robot attempt a square
6. **Calibration (5 min)**: Adjust turn duration to get closer to 90 degrees

### Key Points to Emphasize

- Complex behaviors are built from simple building blocks
- The robot executes each line in order, one after another
- Order matters: if we turn before moving, we go in a different direction
- Real robots need calibration - the 90-degree turn won't be perfect at first

### Teaching the Python Concepts

#### Program Flow (Top to Bottom)
- Python runs line 1, then line 2, then line 3, etc.
- This is called "sequential execution"
- The robot waits for each command to finish before starting the next
- If you swap two lines, the behavior changes!

#### Order Matters
- Ask: "What if we put the turn BEFORE the forward movement?"
- Walk through it physically: face forward, turn left, then go forward
- Compare to: go forward, turn left - you end up in different places!

#### Recognizing Patterns
- Notice the code repeats: forward, stop, turn, stop, forward, stop, turn, stop...
- Point out: "We're doing the same thing 4 times"
- Foreshadow: "Later you'll learn ways to avoid writing the same code 4 times"

### Common Student Mistakes

- **Wrong turn amount**: The 400ms might not be exactly 90 degrees - needs adjustment
- **Forgetting stops**: Without stops, movements might blend together
- **Expecting perfection**: Real robots drift and aren't perfectly accurate

### Calibration Activity

This is a great opportunity to introduce the idea of calibration:
1. Run the code and observe how close the robot gets to making a square
2. If it turns too much, decrease the turn duration (try 350ms)
3. If it turns too little, increase the turn duration (try 450ms)
4. Repeat until satisfied

## Discussion Prompts

1. "Before we run the code, can you predict what path the robot will take?"
2. "What would happen if we only did 3 turns instead of 4?"
3. "Why doesn't the robot make a perfect square? How could we improve it?"
4. "Do you see any patterns in the code? What repeats?"
5. "If you wanted to make the square bigger, what would you change?"

## Extension Activities

### Easy: Rectangle Instead of Square
Modify the code so the robot makes a rectangle - longer on two sides, shorter on the other two.

### Medium: Triangle
Make the robot draw a triangle. Hint: you need 3 sides and 3 turns, but how many degrees should each turn be?

### Challenge: Figure Eight
Can you make the robot trace a figure-eight pattern? This requires both left and right turns!

### Creative: Your Initial
Try to make the robot trace your first initial (letters like L, T, I, and C work well).

## API Reference

### Functions Used in This Lesson

| Function | Description | Line in theta.ts |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `theta.robot_go_ms(direction, speed, duration)` | Move robot for specified milliseconds then stop | [reference/theta.ts:410](../reference/theta.ts#L410) |
| `theta.robot_rotate_ms(direction, speed, duration)` | Spin robot for specified milliseconds then stop | [reference/theta.ts:452](../reference/theta.ts#L452) |
| `theta.robot_stop(mode)` | Stop the robot with brake or coast | [reference/theta.ts:467](../reference/theta.ts#L467) |

### Enums Used

| Enum | Values | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `RxDirection` | `FORWARD`, `REVERSE` | Direction of travel |
| `RxRobotDirection` | `LEFT`, `RIGHT` | Direction of rotation |
| `RxStopMode` | `BRAKE`, `COAST` | How to stop |

### Concept Preview

In future lessons, students will learn:
- **Loops**: A way to repeat code without writing it multiple times
- **Variables**: Store values like turn duration so you only change it in one place
