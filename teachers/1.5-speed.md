# Lesson 1.5: Speed Control

**Student file:** `students/1.5-speed.py`

## Prior Lessons Recap

In **Lesson 1.1**, students learned:
- **Robot**: Moving forward with `robot_go_ms()` and stopping
- **Python**: Function calls, arguments, and comments

In **Lesson 1.2**, students learned:
- **Robot**: Moving in reverse
- **Python**: Enums as named values, changing arguments

In **Lesson 1.3**, students learned:
- **Robot**: Spinning left and right with `robot_rotate_ms()`
- **Python**: Comparing similar functions, different enum types

In **Lesson 1.4**, students learned:
- **Robot**: Combining movements to create sequences (like a square)
- **Python**: Program flow - code executes top to bottom

## Learning Objectives

### Robot Concepts
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand that speed controls how fast the robot moves (not how far)
- Observe that the same duration at different speeds produces different distances
- Choose appropriate speeds for different tasks (precision vs. speed)
- Understand the trade-offs between fast and slow movement

### Python Concepts
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Recognize that **numbers** are a type of value in programming
- Experiment with **parameters** to see how they affect behavior
- Understand that computers treat numbers as precise values (50 is exactly 50)

## Teaching Notes

### Pacing (18-22 minutes)

1. **Recap (3 min)**: Review what we've learned in Module 1
2. **Speed concept (3 min)**: Explain speed as percentage of full power
3. **Demonstration (5 min)**: Run the slow/medium/fast comparison
4. **Observation (3 min)**: Discuss what students noticed
5. **Experimentation (5 min)**: Students try extreme values and edge cases
6. **Module wrap-up (3 min)**: Celebrate completing Module 1!

### Key Points to Emphasize

- Speed is a percentage: 0 = stopped, 100 = full power
- Speed affects how FAST, duration affects how LONG
- Distance = Speed x Time (faster for same time = further)
- Lower speeds give more control/precision
- Higher speeds are faster but harder to control

### Teaching the Python Concepts

#### Numbers as Values
- Numbers in Python are exact: 50 means exactly 50
- Unlike enums (which are words), speed is just a number
- You can use any number from 0 to 100
- What about decimals? (In this case, they work but aren't necessary)

#### Experimenting with Parameters
- Encourage a scientific approach: change ONE thing, observe the result
- Predict before running: "What do you THINK will happen?"
- This is how programmers debug and understand code
- There's no "wrong" experiment - every result teaches us something

#### Understanding Limits
- What happens below 0? (Same as 0 - no negative speed)
- What happens above 100? (Same as 100 - can't exceed full power)
- These are called "bounds" or "limits" - the valid range of a parameter

### Common Student Mistakes

- **Confusing speed and duration**: Speed is how fast, duration is how long
- **Expecting very low speeds to work**: Below ~10, the robot might not move at all
- **Not accounting for momentum**: At high speeds, the robot takes longer to stop

### Celebrating Module 1 Completion!

This is the final lesson of Module 1. Take time to:
- Review all the concepts learned (forward, reverse, spinning, sequences, speed)
- Show how much code students can now write and understand
- Preview what's coming in Module 2 (hint: LEDs, sensors, or more control)

## Discussion Prompts

1. "If the same robot moves for the same duration, why does it travel different distances?"
2. "When would you want to use a slow speed? When would fast be better?"
3. "What's the relationship between speed, time, and distance?"
4. "If you wanted to travel a specific distance, would you change speed or duration? Or both?"
5. "What skills have you learned in Module 1? Can you list them all?"

## Extension Activities

### Easy: Speed Race
Create a race between "slow and steady" (speed 30, duration 4000) vs "fast and brief" (speed 70, duration 1700). Do they travel the same distance?

### Medium: Precision Parking
Place a target 50cm away. Find the best combination of speed and duration to stop exactly on the target. Which approach is more accurate: slow or fast?

### Challenge: Speed Ramp
Make the robot gradually increase speed: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 - like accelerating a car!

### Creative: Mood Movement
Create a "mood" for your robot using speed:
- "Sleepy robot" - very slow movements
- "Excited robot" - fast, quick movements
- "Careful robot" - slow, precise movements with lots of stops

## Module 1 Summary

Congratulations! In Module 1, students have learned:

| Lesson | Robot Concept | Python Concept |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| 1.1 | Forward motion | Function calls, arguments, comments |
| 1.2 | Reverse motion | Enums, changing arguments |
| 1.3 | Spinning | Similar functions, different enums |
| 1.4 | Sequences | Program flow, order matters |
| 1.5 | Speed control | Numbers, experimenting |

Students can now:
- Make the robot move forward, backward, and spin
- Create movement sequences and patterns
- Control the speed of movements
- Write and understand Python code with function calls and comments
