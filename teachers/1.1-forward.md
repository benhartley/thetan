# Lesson 1.1: Forward Motion

**Student file:** `students/1.1-forward.py`

## Module 1 Overview: Basic Movement

This module introduces students to controlling the Theta robot's movement. Over 5 lessons, students will learn to:

1. **Lesson 1.1** - Move forward and stop
2. **Lesson 1.2** - Move in reverse
3. **Lesson 1.3** - Spin left and right
4. **Lesson 1.4** - Combine movements into sequences
5. **Lesson 1.5** - Control speed for different effects

Each lesson builds on the previous one, with code accumulating so students can see their program grow.

## Learning Objectives

### Robot Concepts
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand that robots are controlled by code instructions
- Use the `theta.robot_go_ms()` function to make the robot move forward
- Use the `theta.robot_stop()` function to stop the robot
- Explain the difference between speed (how fast) and duration (how long)

### Python Concepts
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Recognize a **function call** (code that tells the computer to do something)
- Understand that **arguments** are values passed to functions inside parentheses
- Write and read **comments** (lines starting with `#` that explain code)

## Teaching Notes

### Pacing (15-20 minutes)

1. **Introduction (3 min)**: Show the robot, explain it follows instructions
2. **Code walkthrough (5 min)**: Go through each line of the example
3. **First run (2 min)**: Load code onto micro:bit, watch it run
4. **Experimentation (8 min)**: Students modify values and observe changes
5. **Discussion (2 min)**: Share observations

### Key Points to Emphasize

- The robot does exactly what the code tells it - no more, no less
- Speed is 0-100 (percentage of full power)
- Duration is in milliseconds (1000ms = 1 second)
- The `Brake` stop mode stops quickly; `Coast` slows down gradually

### Teaching the Python Concepts

#### Function Calls
- Explain that `theta.robot_go_ms(...)` is like giving the robot a command
- The name before the parentheses tells us WHAT to do
- Compare to real life: "Walk forward" is a command, "robot_go_ms" is the robot's command

#### Arguments
- The values inside the parentheses are called "arguments"
- They tell the function HOW to do the action
- `robot_go_ms(RxDirection.FORWARD, 50, 2000)` has three arguments:
  1. Which direction (FORWARD)
  2. How fast (50)
  3. How long (2000 milliseconds)

#### Comments
- Lines starting with `#` are for humans, not the robot
- The robot ignores them completely
- They help us remember what the code does
- Good programmers write comments to explain their thinking

### Common Student Mistakes

- **Forgetting units**: Duration is in milliseconds, not seconds. 2 seconds = 2000ms
- **Speed too high**: Starting with speed 100 can make the robot hard to control. Start with 30-50
- **Not enough space**: Ensure clear floor space before running the robot
- **Expecting instant changes**: After modifying code, remind students to download to micro:bit again

### Safety Reminders

- Keep fingers away from wheels while robot is running
- Use lower speeds (30-50) when learning
- Always have a clear path for the robot

## Discussion Prompts

1. "What do you think will happen if we change the speed from 50 to 80?" (Prediction before testing)
2. "Why do you think we need to tell the robot to stop? Can't it figure that out itself?"
3. "What's the difference between `Brake` and `Coast`? When might you use each one?"
4. "If you wanted the robot to travel further, what could you change? Is there more than one way?"
5. "Can you find the comments in the code? What do they tell you?"

## Extension Activities

### Easy: Different Distances
Try making the robot travel exactly to a target (a piece of tape on the floor). What combination of speed and duration works best?

### Medium: Add More Comments
Have students add their own comments explaining what each line does in their own words.

### Challenge: Speed Test
Compare two approaches: high speed for short time vs. low speed for longer time. Which is more accurate for reaching a target?

### Creative: Robot Dance
Create a sequence of movements (forward, stop, forward, stop) to make the robot "dance" to a rhythm.
