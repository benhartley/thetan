# Lesson 1.2: Reverse Motion

**Student file:** `students/1.2-reverse.py`

## Prior Lessons Recap

In **Lesson 1.1**, students learned:
- **Robot**: How to move the robot forward using `robot_go_ms()` and stop it with `robot_stop()`
- **Python**: What function calls are, how arguments work, and how to write comments

## Learning Objectives

### Robot Concepts
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Make the robot move in reverse (backward)
- Understand that direction is controlled by an argument
- Create a simple forward-then-reverse sequence

### Python Concepts
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand **enums** as named values (like `RxDirection.FORWARD` and `RxDirection.REVERSE`)
- Recognize that changing an argument changes the behavior
- See how the same function can do different things based on its arguments

## Teaching Notes

### Pacing (12-15 minutes)

1. **Recap (2 min)**: Quick review of Lesson 1.1 - what did the robot do?
2. **New concept (3 min)**: Introduce the idea of direction as a choice
3. **Code walkthrough (4 min)**: Show how we added reverse movement
4. **Run and observe (2 min)**: Watch the forward-then-reverse sequence
5. **Experimentation (4 min)**: Students modify the code

### Key Points to Emphasize

- We're using the SAME function (`robot_go_ms`) but with a DIFFERENT argument
- `RxDirection.FORWARD` and `RxDirection.REVERSE` are like menu options
- The function is flexible - it does what we tell it based on the arguments

### Teaching the Python Concepts

#### Enums (Named Values)
- Explain that `RxDirection.FORWARD` is a "named value" or "enum"
- It's easier to read than using numbers (imagine if FORWARD was 0 and REVERSE was 1)
- The dot notation means "FORWARD belongs to the RxDirection group"
- Think of it like a menu: "RxDirection" is the menu, "FORWARD" and "REVERSE" are the choices

#### Changing Arguments
- Show the two `robot_go_ms` calls side by side
- Only ONE thing changed: `FORWARD` became `REVERSE`
- The speed (50) and duration (2000) stayed the same
- This is powerful: one small change, different behavior!

### Common Student Mistakes

- **Spelling errors**: `RxDirection.FOWARD` (missing 'R') won't work
- **Wrong capitalization**: Must be `FORWARD` not `forward` or `Forward`
- **Forgetting the prefix**: Just `REVERSE` won't work, needs `RxDirection.REVERSE`

### Building on Previous Code

Point out that this lesson's code CONTAINS all of Lesson 1.1's code, plus new code below. This is intentional - programs grow by adding, not replacing.

## Discussion Prompts

1. "What changed between the first `robot_go_ms` and the second one? What stayed the same?"
2. "Why do you think it's called `RxDirection` instead of just `Direction`?"
3. "If FORWARD and REVERSE are the only two choices, what would happen if you tried `RxDirection.LEFT`?"
4. "How is choosing `Forward` or `Reverse` similar to choosing from a menu at a restaurant?"

## Extension Activities

### Easy: Return Journey
Modify the code so the robot goes forward, stops, reverses, and ends up back where it started.

### Medium: Different Speeds
Make the robot go forward slowly (speed 30) but reverse quickly (speed 70). What do you observe?

### Challenge: Matching Distances
The robot might not travel the exact same distance forward and backward. Can you adjust the durations to make it return precisely to the starting point?

### Creative: Shuttle Run
Create a pattern where the robot goes forward-reverse-forward-reverse multiple times, like a shuttle running back and forth.

### Functions Used in This Lesson

| Function | Description | Line in theta.ts |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `theta.robot_go_ms(direction, speed, duration)` | Move robot for specified milliseconds then stop | [reference/theta.ts:410](../reference/theta.ts#L410) |
| `theta.robot_stop(mode)` | Stop the robot with brake or coast | [reference/theta.ts:467](../reference/theta.ts#L467) |

### Enums Used

| Enum | Values | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `RxDirection` | `FORWARD`, `REVERSE` | Direction of travel |
| `RxStopMode` | `BRAKE`, `COAST` | How to stop (quick brake vs. gradual coast) |
