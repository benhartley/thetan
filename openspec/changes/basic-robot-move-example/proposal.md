## Why

This change addresses the need for simple, beginner-friendly examples in the Theta Robot MakeCode Python tutorial series. By providing a basic movement example, students can quickly understand how to control the robot's motors and experiment with different parameters, building confidence before progressing to more complex programs.

## What Changes

- Add a new example file demonstrating basic forward movement using the Theta library
- Include explanatory comments in the code to describe each part
- Add encouragement for students to modify values and observe effects

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `basic-robot-movement`: A simple example showing how to make the Theta robot move forward with configurable speed and duration

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- No existing capabilities are being modified -->

## Impact

- Adds one new example file to the examples directory
- No changes to existing APIs or dependencies
- Increases educational value of the tutorial series
